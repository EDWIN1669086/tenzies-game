In my tenzies game, you are given 10 dice and your job is to make all the dice show the same face value (ie. all the dice show 6 pips).
You can keep a die value by clicking on the die and it will turn green. There is a timer implemented so that you can keep track of your 
best score and a counter that displays how many rolls it took you during that round.
